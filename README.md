# SociAuctor
## :mechanical_arm: Inspiration  

Our SociAuctor website is a platform for buying and selling unique, high-quality products, with all proceeds going towards funding for those in need. Our auctions feature a wide range of items, from rare collectibles and one-of-a-kind artwork to exclusive experiences and luxury goods.Every time you bid on an item or make a purchase, you're not only getting something you love â€“ you're also contributing to a good cause. All of the money raised through our auctions goes to needy people.


## :bulb: Solution  
We propose a full stack web application which would serve as a bridge between public auctions and crowdfunding . The idea is to have an auction platform along with a crowdfunding platform such that the base auction amount of the auction will be directly transfered to the crowdfunding activity. Any sum higher than the base auction amount will be sent to the seller / creator of the product. Both seller(s) and patient(s) are beneficaries in this idea.
